### üñ• Review files
1. `app/app.py`<br>
This is where the basic boilerplate for your app is set up. As mentioned above, the boilerplate for SQlAlchemy is slightly different than what we wrote last week when we used SQLAlchemy on its own. The URI for your database is stored as a configuration attribute on the `app` object. On line 8, we run the `SQLAlchemy` function with `app` passed in to instantiate an database object that acts as both our enginer, sessionmaker, and declarative base. Confirm that the URI on line 6 correctly points to your database.<br>
On line 13, we invoke the `run` method on `app` to start our development server. If you run this file (`python app/app.py)`, you'll see some feedback in your terminal saying you are now running a local server on port 5000. You can now access this web app or its endpoints at http://localhost:5000/.
2. `app/models.py`<br>
Your models are defined by `app/models.py`. You'll notice that all of the table definitons extend `db.Model` as do any Flask-SQLAlchemy helpers, like `Column` or `String` or `Integer`. You might also notice that each model definition has a `serialize` mehtod in order to return data about our models in JSON. In the future, we might want to utilize a Python package that handles serialization for us.
3. `app/db.py`<br>
Our tables are created and seeded in this file. If you run this file (`python app/db.py`), you'll see some feedback in your terminal and then be able to see changes to your database using `psql` or your chosen GUI.

### üñ• Let's add more HTML to our template in `tasks.html`
In `app/api.py`, write a simple route to get all tasks from your database. You can use the `Task.query.all()` method. When you are done, test your route by sending a `GET` request to `localhost:5000/tasks` in Postman.
